# Python Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects I completed as part of a Udemy course on Python basics. Each project was created to help me build a foundation in Python through practical, hands-on experience with simple yet useful applications.

## Project Overview

These mini-projects were designed to introduce core Python concepts in a fun and approachable way.

### Projects Included

1. **Audio Extractor**  
   Extracts audio from video files. This project introduced me to working with media files and showed how to use Python libraries to manipulate and process audio data.

2. **Windows Notification Generator**  
   Displays a notification in the Windows notification center. This helped me learn how to interact with the operating system directly through Python.

3. **QR Code Reader**  
   Reads and decodes information from a QR code image. This project taught me the basics of image processing.

4. **Password Generator**  
   Generates a secure, random password based on custom criteria. I learned about random number generation, string manipulation, and handling user inputs in Python.

5. **Other Small Projects**  


## Purpose

The purpose of these mini-projects was to build my confidence in Python by applying it to real-world problems. Working through each project helped me to:

- Understand fundamental programming concepts in Python
- Gain experience with external libraries for specific tasks
- Learn how to handle various data types and file formats
